I absolutely love this setup. It’s simple, it’s distributed and it just works! On top of that, it does not cost any money to host it (given that I already own domain name).

Most “fun” thing is: broken part was EventMachine (1.2.7), which Jekyll needs because it’s a dependency of… em-websocket! What static blog generator has to do with websockets? That’s not a good tech, sorry. But that’s quite a learning experience!" />
