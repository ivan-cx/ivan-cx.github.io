Iâ€™m Ivan Kuznetsov. This is my homepage. I am a programmer who specializes in data intensive areas (game development, bioinformatics and other).

I intend to exercise my writing muscle by spreading the word of good tech. All kinds of good:

 - good tools to build things with (like C programming language)
 - tools that greatly improve our everyday life (like electric toothbrush)
 - ways to do good in the world using tech (like effective charity)

First example would be the tech behind this blog itself: it's built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages. I absolutely love this setup. It's simple, it's distributed and it just works! On top of that, it does not cost any money to host it (given that I already own domain name).
