To keep up with the development of new technology and ever increasing flood
of information one needs a strategy. 
Best way I know so far is: **learn how to learn**. 
Regardless if you are fourteen or forty - you need skills to learn new skills
efficiently.
If you had such training as part of your past education - good for you!
I didn't, so here's a couple of free resources that were invaluable to me.

I started with ["Learning how to learn" on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) - very enjoyable experience
with great practical advice on learning new skills.
Free [anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1266436294) is available
for the course.
I find a weekly course newsletter very usefull as well.

Another great resource for inspiration and advice is Dr. Richard W. Hamming's
lectures, particularly ["Intro to The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4b-52jtos&list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30&index=1)
and rest of the course. Last lecture in the course is ["You and your research"](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) - a masterpiece.

When you know how to learn and why, it is much easier to focus on more salient questions: what to learn? What is important?
