<p>To keep up with the development of new technology and ever increasing flood of information one needs a strategy. Best thing that I found: learn how to learn. Improve skills to learn new skills efficiently. If you had such training as part of your past education - good for you! I didn’t, so here’s a couple of free resources that were invaluable to me.</p>
<p>I started with <q>Learning how to learn</q> on coursera - very enjoyable experience with great practical advice on learning new skills. I find good recommendations in course’s weekly newsletter, even long after completing the course.</p>
<p>Another great resource for inspiration and advice is Dr. Richard W. Hamming’s lectures, particularly <q>Intro to The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn</q> and rest of the course. Last lecture in the course is <q>You and your research</q> - a masterpiece.</p>
<p>When you know how to learn and why, it is much easier to focus on more salient questions: what to learn? What is important?</p>
