To keep up with the development of new technology and ever increasing flood of information one needs a strategy. Best thing that I found: learn how to learn. Improve skills to learn new skills efficiently. If you had such training as part of your past education - good for you! I didn’t, so here’s a couple of free resources that were invaluable to me.

I started with “Learning how to learn” on coursera - very enjoyable experience with great practical advice on learning new skills. I find good recommendations in course's weekly newsletter, even long after completing the course.

Another great resource for inspiration and advice is Dr. Richard W. Hamming’s lectures, particularly “Intro to The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn” and rest of the course. Last lecture in the course is “You and your research” - a masterpiece.

When you know how to learn and why, it is much easier to focus on more salient questions: what to learn? What is important?
