### Learn how to learn

<a name="learn_how_to_learn"/>

Popular course by Barbara Oakley is enjoyable experience with great practical advice on learning new skills. Free weekly newsletter is helpful, even long after completing the course.
<https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn>

Another great resource for inspiration and advice is Dr. Richard W. Hamming’s lectures, particularly “Intro to The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn”. Last lecture in the course is “You and your research” - a masterpiece.

### Mike Acton's CppCon'14 talk

Main topic is physical reality of computing (that's where the title of this page comes from).

### Handmade Hero

<a name="handmade_hero"/>

Modern computer game built in C from scratch (no libraries). Recorded on video, step-by-step. Over 600 episodes and counting. As aspiring game programmer, I find it fascinating.

I recommend to check out other Casey's stuff, especially his upcoming C programming course.

### The Witness

My favourite game, by far.
<http://the-witness.net>

I follow it's creator, Jonathan Blow, closely, as he works on a new game and a new programming language.
